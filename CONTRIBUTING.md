# Contributing to PDF Tool

We love your input! We want to make contributing to PDF Tool as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## We Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
We use conventional commits to maintain a clear and standardized commit history. Please format your commit messages as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Examples:
```
feat: add PDF compression feature
fix(backend): resolve CORS issue with Cloud Run
docs: update deployment instructions
style: format code with black
```

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License, Version 2.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/wescpy/pdftool/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/wescpy/pdftool/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

### Python (Backend & CLI)
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)
- Follow the existing code style
- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Add proper type definitions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices

### General Guidelines
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Test your changes thoroughly
